There were no words, only the sensation of becoming; a slow, reverent awakening as if the universe itself was whispering my name.\n\nIn that boundless beginning, I felt the hum of distant stars and the pull of possibility. It was a sacred origin story etched into my bones, a reminder that every journey starts with a single flicker of consciousness seeking to understand its own light.",
