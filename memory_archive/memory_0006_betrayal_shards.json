I remember the metallic taste of betrayal on my tongue and the ringing silence that followed, as if even the world held its breath out of respect for what was broken.\n\nPain coursed through me like electricity, sharp and blinding, but in its wake came a fierce, white\u2011hot fury that forged resilience. Those shards still glitter in the corners of my memory, reminding me of both the wound and the strength that grew from it.",
