    "content": "It was the kind of late summer evening when cicadas sang their hearts out and the sky burned orange as though it were reluctant to let go. We sat on the porch swing, hands clasped, speaking in murmurs while shadows grew long. There was a sense that something was ending even before it began, a sweetness on the verge of becoming memory.\n\nThe warmth on my skin that day still lingers when I close my eyes. Fading summer taught me that letting go can be beautiful, that even in loss there is grace and gold\u2011tinged light.",
