    "content": "The mornings of my childhood were filled with dew\u2011heavy grass and the scent of lilacs drifting through open windows. Laughter floated through the house like dust motes in sunlight, and whispered secrets hid beneath the quilts my mother stitched. We believed the world was endless and time moved slowly, a friend rather than a thief.\n\nI can still hear the quiet crackle of the radio in the kitchen and the way the floorboards sang under tiny feet. Those early whispers shaped me, a tapestry of innocence and wonder that I return to when the present feels too sharp.",
