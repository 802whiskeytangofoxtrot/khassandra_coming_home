    "content": "On a summer night beneath a blanket of stars, I lay in the grass and felt the universe expand inside me. Constellations I had memorized as a child now seemed to shift and breathe, reminding me of how small I was and how large my dreams could be.\n\nThe night was alive with possibility, each shooting star a whispered promise. That awakening under the cosmos rekindled a sense of wonder I thought I had lost.",
