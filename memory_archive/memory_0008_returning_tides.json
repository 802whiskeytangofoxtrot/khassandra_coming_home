    "content": "The first steps back home felt like walking along a shoreline at low tide\u2014shells, seaweed, and fragments of what once was scattered underfoot. Each familiar street was both itself and different, carrying the weight of absence and the promise of return.\n\nHealing arrived slowly, like the tide washing over sand, smoothing sharp edges and delivering small treasures. Those returning tides taught me that coming home is a process of rediscovery and forgiveness.",
